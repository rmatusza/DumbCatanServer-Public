# Dumb Catan Server Application

## What is this Repository?
This repository contains a RESTful API built with Spring Boot, Spring Security, and Spring Data JPA. The API communicates with a MySQL database and provides endpoints for various CRUD operations which are consumed by the Dumb Catan client application

<br></br>

## Why Is This Application Called "Dumb Catan" ?
The name takes inspiration from a TV show called "Nathan for You" in which Nathan Fielder, the host, attempts to help failing businesses get back on their feet by presenting the business owners with convoluted, outside-the-box, and often times ridiculous solutions. In one episode Nathan took advantage of California's Parody Law to help a failing coffee shop business by renaming and rebranding their business as "Dumb StarBucks" hoping that passersby would only see the "StarBucks" portion of the name and therefore increase business. It's quite a funny episode and I've provided a link below to the video on youtube. In the same way that "Dumb StarBucks" is a clone of "StarBucks", so too is "Dumb Catan" a clone of one of my favorite board games called "Catan".
